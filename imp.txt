React.js and React Native share a common foundation, but they serve different purposes:

React.js (React):
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) on the web.
It’s primarily used for creating web applications and websites.
React components render UI elements in the browser using a virtual DOM (Document Object Model).
Developers write React code in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and use JSX (JavaScript XML) to define UI components.
React.js is not platform-specific; it runs in web browsers.
React Native:
React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications.
It allows developers to create mobile apps for Android and iOS using a single codebase.
React Native compiles JavaScript code into native app components.
Developers write React Native code in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and use components specific to mobile platforms.
React Native provides access to native APIs (such as camera, geolocation, and notifications) through JavaScript bridges.
It aims to provide a native-like experience while sharing code across platforms.
In summary, React.js is for web UIs, while React Native is for mobile app development. Both leverage React’s component-based architecture, but they target different environments.
